### ## 📜 About The Project
This project is the cornerstone of the 1337 curriculum. The goal is to build a personal library (`libft.a`) by re-implementing a set of standard C functions. This library will serve as a fundamental toolkit for all future C projects.

### ## ✨ Implemented Functions
This is a list of the functions completed so far:

| Function           | Description                                  | Category     |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| `ft_isalpha`       | Checks if a character is alphabetic.         | Character    |
| `ft_isdigit`       | Checks if a character is a digit.            | Character    |
| `ft_isalnum`       | Checks if a character is alphanumeric.       | Character    |
| `ft_isascii`       | Checks if a character is in the ASCII set.   | Character    |
| `ft_isprint`       | Checks if a character is printable.          | Character    |
| `ft_memset`        | Fills a block of memory with a specific value. | Memory       |
| `ft_bzero`         | Fills a block of memory with zeros.          | Memory       |
| `ft_atoi`          | Converts a string to an integer.             | String Conv. |

*(This list will be updated as more functions are completed)*
